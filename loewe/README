# Preparations
In order to load Python and GCC in a recent version run 

./build_before

This will ensure the appropriate modules are loaded in your ~/.bashrc
Log-Out and Log-In again to make sure, the module are loaded.
Check that GCC 5.2+ and Python 3.5+ are enabled by executing

gcc --version
python3 --version

(The build script will check again, but better be safe than sorry)

# Building stuff
The build script will download all repositories and python modules needed,
rewrite some configurations and build the stuff. EVERYTHING takes place
in one directory. So you can be sure your system remains untouched.
In order to do so, we will create a virtual Python enviroment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
that has to be loaded after installation before EVERY execution.
The required command is displayed in at the end of the installation.
Watch out for it !

mkdir lfr # or any other name
cd lfr
PATH-TO-BUILD-SCRIPT/build

This will result in the following structure:
lfr
|- em-lfr        # Old EM-LFR Repo (Bachelor Thesis). 
|  |- release    # Contains binaries
|- extmem-lfr    # New Repo. Does contain the experiment scripts
|- networkit     # NetworKit build dir. Not needed anymore
|- python-env    # This contains the Python virtual env

To load the Python Env add the following line to your .bashrc (The correct path is displayed by the build script)

. ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-LFR-DIR/python-env/bin/activate

Make sure to include the ". " at the beginning of the line.
Log-Out and Log-In. Make sure your bash promt begins with (python-env)
